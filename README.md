This is my dotfile setup with chezmoi which includes configuration for i3, zsh, alacritty, nvim and more.

## Goals
- New install made easy
- One setup works on multiple platforms (arch, fedora, i3, gnome etc.)
- Use tested but modern ways
- Easy to use setup that's also easy to eyes
- Have a setup that feels like my own and doesn't need to be changed all the
  time

## Programs
- shell: zsh
- terminal: alacritty
- editor: vscode, nvim
- window manager: i3-gaps on laptop, gnome on desktop
- browser: firefox-developer-edition
